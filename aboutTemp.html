            <p>I have a passion for UX development. From creating music as a lead guitarist in multiple bands to creating cocktails as a professional bartender, User Experience has always been the core focus of my diverse professional history. The rhythm and harmony of artistry and technology that Iâ€™ve applied to my work allows me to develop content that maximizes user experience for much more than just how it looks. I want to write code for the future, for the Internet of things.</p>
            <p>I grew up in the Seattle area and have always loved the North West and all that it has to offer. I've played guitar for 15 years now, and have toured the country in a van with multiple bands. Playing SXSW and CMJ festivals in Austin, TX and New York was the highlight of my music career. In the summer I love to wakeboard and go to my family's beach cabin in Manzanita, OR. In the winter my passion has always been the snow. I skied from the time I could stand between my dad's legs and have snowboarded since I was 12.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about living life to the fullest! Coding is something that ignites the curiosity inside me. To me coding for user experience is like playing with the best most versatile Lego set ever to have existed. My other passions are my girlfriend Carly, our dog Paisley and the wonderful game of Golf. If you've read this far I'm probably boring you by now. Thank you for visiting my site and look for major improvements coming soon!</p>
