                    <h1>Blog Post #1: 4/7/2014</h1>
                    <p>I'm just now beginning my experience at Code Fellows. The UX Dev Accelerator is an 8 week intensive process where in I'll be hardened as a UX dev in the fires of 9am-4pm coding monday through friday.</p>
                    <p>Dale Sande is the wizard in charge of overseeing our torture/education and the guy is amazing. He's a wealth of knowledge and he's a down to earth, funny, cool person to be around much less learn from. I feel very privileged to be able to be a part of this experience and I plan on making the most of it.</p>
                    <p>That being said, I have a <strong>TON</strong> of work to do. I have hours and hours of reading and coding ahead of me and as a relatively inexperienced developer I feel like I'm at the middle to back of the class in terms of pre accelerator knowledge. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. I find that in most everything in life, I greatly enjoy being the weak link. As negative as that sounds being the least skilled at anything and surrounding yourself with intelligent capable people that are better than you, <strong>WILL</strong> make you better. Coding is no exception to this rule.</p>
                    <p>Over the next 8 weeks I will try my best to document my journey from coding novice to professional and if my experience can help even one person with their code, their career, or their life, then this will have been worth it. I will also be using the skills I learn in the class to make this into a portfolio of sorts. It will be interesting to see how I am able to develope this simple website/blog into a fully interactive and functioning portfolio of my knowledge and capabilities.</p>

                    <p>Below is a screen cap of my terminal port. Terminal is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate manage and manipulate files and directories but most IMPORTANTLY it is the tool that we use for git. Git is a language/application? that is an all powerful way to push and pull files from computer to computer and from computer to the internet.</p>
