                    <h1>Blog post #7.1: 4/14/2014</h1>
                    <p><strong>How did I do that?</strong></p>
                    <p>So, in order to call the map you have to use javascript.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lE4wjeE.png" title="Javascript used for Google Maps"/></a>
                    </figure>
                    <p>A series of things are happening in this example. First you create a variable called mapwrapper. With that var we, on the 'document' create a 'div' called mapwrapper. We also subsequently create a css class called mapwrapper so that we can use the stylesheet to adjust the layout and look of the div.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6goawUD.png" title="CSS stylesheet"/></a>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Next, we do the exact same thing that we did with mapwrapper, but this time we're creating a div called mapcanvas. Now map canvas is the actual functioning map that calls the Google code and generates the map. Map wrapper is a container that we plan to put around mapcanvas in order to make it responsive to our CSS! So far so good? Good. Next we call, in the 'document', and query to find a selector called 'map'. This is the first time we're actually assigning anything to an existing html element. If you inspect element you'll see the article with a class of 'map'. So what happens with appendChild is that we are inserting the div of mapwrapper we created into the last child spot of the article. We run this again but instead insert the id mapcanvas inside the mapwrapper class. OMG it's so simple!</p>

                    <p><strong>I'm a Map I'm a map</strong></p>
                    <p>We've learned to use javascript to call on google all powerful map services. The google API is a deep deep hole that we can go down, and I'm just scratching the surface with this. you'll also notice hopefully that I've made this responsive to screen size. On your browser get in the habit of grabbing the screen edge with your mouse and drag it back and forth to see if elements are adjusting size.</p>

Now take your mouse and drag the edge of your browser screen. Responsive sites should adjust content based on what is using it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Social Media!</strong></p>
                    <p>Every day we've been here at code fellows, every one has been telling us how important it is to not only learn how to code and give our all, but also to network and make yourself as hirable as possible. Networking not only includes attending tech meet-ups and talking with people about what they do, what they love and hate about their jobs, but also becoming part of the social media-sphere that is twitter, github, linkedIn, and so much more. I've started this blog as one of many ways that I will be trying to share and to show the world or anyone who's listening that I'm in this for real. I really love what I'm learning every day and to get paid to create and contribute and to learn new tech and languages is a dream of mine that I <strong>WILL</strong> achieve. At the top of the page are the links to all of my pertinent social media. I would be honored if you were to even visit my pages much less follow or subscribe to them! Cheers!</p>

                    <h1>Blog post #3: 4/8/2014</h1>
                    <p><strong>Semantic html!</strong></p>
                    <p>Before we dive head deep into writing code, Dale has been impressing upon us the importance of semantics when writing code; focusing specifically on HTML5. By semantics I mean literally what the word actually means. There's the old saying when two people are arguing in agreement that "we're just arguing semantics" but the dev world is trying its best to establish a world wide standard of just what and how you're supposed to tag class or call things in HTML. <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">Nicolas Gallagher</a> writes an interesting <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">article</a> about it.</p>
                    <p>We're also implementing semantics for the purpose of UX (user experience). In the wild west that was the first days of writing html and css semantics too a back seat to the back end code and "as long as the page works" dev's used to be happy. Dale and a select few, including me and my 13 other classmates, are trying to change that not just for better code but to make the Internet universally accessible throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Current access to the Internet for people with disabilities is atrocious and we're going to learn to change that!</p>

                    <p>Below is a screen cap of my terminal port. Terminal is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate manage and manipulate files and directories but most IMPORTANTLY it is the tool that we use for git. Git is a language/application? that is an all powerful way to push and pull files from computer to computer and from computer to the internet.</p>
                    <img src="https://github.com/maxbrockman453/maxbrockman453.github.io/blob/master/images/Screenshot%202014-05-07%2010.23.36.png?raw=true" />

                    <h1>Blog Post #1: 4/7/2014</h1>
                    <p>I'm just now beginning my experience at Code Fellows. The UX Dev Accelerator is an 8 week intensive process wherein I'll be hardened as a UX dev in the fires of 9am-4pm coding monday through friday.</p>
                    <p>Dale Sande is the wizard in charge of overseeing our torture/education and the guy is amazing. He's a wealth of knowledge and he's a down to earth, funny, cool person to be around much less learn from. I feel very privileged to be able to be a part of this experience and I plan on making the most of it.</p>
                    <p>That being said, I have a <strong>TON</strong> of work to do. I have hours and hours of reading and coding ahead of me and as a relatively inexperienced developer I feel like I'm at the middle to back of the class in terms of pre accelerator knowledge. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. I find that in most everything in life, I greatly enjoy being the weak link. As negative as that sounds being the least skilled at anything and surrounding yourself with intelligent capable people that are better than you, <strong>WILL</strong> make you better. Coding is no exception to this rule.</p>
                    <p>Over the next 8 weeks I will try my best to document my journey from coding novice to professional and if my experience can help even one person with their code, their career, or their life, then this will have been worth it. I will also be using the skills I learn in the class to make this into a portfolio of sorts. It will be interesting to see how I am able to develope this simple website/blog into a fully interactive and functioning portfolio of my knowledge and capabilities.</p>
